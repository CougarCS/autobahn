[Autobahn](http://autobahn.cougarcs.com/) is a social network for CougarCS, the Computer Science student
organisation and ACM Chapter at the University of Houston.

The purpose is to facilitate connecting people to projects and people with
skills.

## Dev

- install Vagrant
- start up the Vagrant VM

  ```shell
  vagrant up
  ```

- Setup the configuratin file from the template:

  ```shell
  cp config.yml.example config.yml
  ```

- add a GitHub API token to config.yml in the `Auth::Github` section:
  - if you want to use a server on localhost:8586 for development, use

    ```yaml
    plugins:
      "Auth::Github":
        client_id: "08ab5c7a5e8ee1449102"
        client_secret: "53bd83ea6a228297d934ddbd09adf83bb54228f0"
    ```

    in that section.

  - otherwise, register an application at <https://github.com/settings/applications>.
    Settings should be

        Homepage: http://autobahn.cougarcs.com/
        Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:8586/auth/github/callback

    change the callback URL to match the port you will run the application on (default: 8586)

- run the development server

  ```shell
  ./start_dev
  ```

- setup upstream for your git repo

  ```shell
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/zmughal/autobahn.git
  ```

- To get the changes from upstream, run

```shell
git pull upstream master
```
